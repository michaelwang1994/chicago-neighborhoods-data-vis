For my final project, I decided to use the same data source as my midterm project: the Chicago Census data.

Hybrid Structure: I used a martini structure to give the readers an introduction to the topic and terms (e.g. "Hardship Index") and so that they could be familiar with the interface.
Furthermore, due to the high number of Chicago neighborhoods, the martini structure made sense as it allowed users to go through each of the neighborhoods one-by-one.

Scenes: The first scene introduces the reader to the topic. They are forced to stay on this first scene until they press "Continue". As the user moves his/her mouse across the map, each neighborhood would display its relevant statistics and description, indicating a change in scene.
I've also added a "highlight" color, so the reader can keep track of which neighborhood he/she is looking at.

Annotations: I've placed annotations in the form of a summary of the neighborhood from wikipedia. It is up to the reader how much he/she wants to read. If he/she is interested, they can click on the map and go the wikipedia page directly.

Parameters and Triggers: The parameters and triggers that impact the visualization are your mouse position and if you have moused-over a neighborhood already. As you move over each neighborhood, they get colored with respect to their hardship index. They remain colored even when you mouse-out the neighbhorhood.
As they mouse-over each state and observe the effect, they should come to an intuitive understanding of how it works.
